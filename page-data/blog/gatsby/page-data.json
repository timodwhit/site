At that time, I had 0 development\nexperience and I didn't know HTML, CSS, PHP, etc. I fell into a situation where\nthe small mom-and-pop operation needed a commerce website to sell their product.\nAnd with 0 knowledge in my pocket I felt I could build a site.</p>\n<p>I asked my friend who was doing web development and she said \"You should build a\nDrupal site\". Drupal 7.x just launched (I believe it was in BC), and drupal commerce\n1.x had just come out. So building a commerce site on Drupal was definitely the\nway to go.</p>\n<p>Since then, I have cut my teeth quite a bit, I have learned a lot and have built\ncountless websites with the beautiful codebase and contrib modules that comprise\nthe Drupal ecosystem. There are things I love and things I loathe, but I know it\nquite well to whip up this simple blog without hesitation.</p>\n<p>But I chose not to.</p>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>A friend told me about <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>. I listen.</li>\n<li>I'm cheap. I don't want to pay for hosting this site.</li>\n<li>\n<p>My time is worth something.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't want to spin up a server to host this website. (Can I, yes. Should I, no.)</li>\n<li>I don't want to maintain a server with my blog on it. I do that enough in my\nday to day affairs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gatsby is built on React</li>\n<li>Drupal is coupling with React</li>\n<li>I love writing my posts in Markdown.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Why I regret it</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>My time is worth something.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While I learned a lot with this project, I'm not sure it was overly useful\nor the time savings I was expecting</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Because this is my first react project, I'm not sure what is specific to\nGatsby and what is best practice.  See the above point about time.</li>\n<li>I traded the complexity of Drupal/Modules for Node/Packages. When I come back\nto this in a year to do some dev work, how many things will be out of date and\nhow easy will it be to fix it? Time will tell.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Have fun.</li>\n<li>Templates are always the best way to learn. Take it apart, focus on it and\nreally ingest what is happening.</li>\n<li>I missed writing.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why Gatsby was my choice","date":"May 03, 2020","description":"As a Drupal developer, why would I choose gatsby?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/gatsby/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","712016698"]}
