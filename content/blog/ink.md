I made something! https://ink-jade.vercel.app/

The code is here: https://github.com/timodwhit/Ink

## Motivation
Problems:
- I have a hard time remembering a lot.
- I have a hard time wanting to carry a journal and pen.
- I get paralysis when thinking of how to organize digital notes
- I don't like the notes app for journaling. (There isn't a date when it was created, it mixes with other notes, it is hard to read past entries in context)

 Solutions:
 - Use Apple's Journal (I tried, it doesn't show me the full post unless I click into it)
 - Use a google doc, and just put the date (the date part is the extra work)
 - Reinvent the wheel (ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€)

## Solution
Whilst texting my best buds, I had the realization that our conversation is an active journal of our friendship. I go back to posts, re-read what my friends have written, show pictures to my wife, etc. Ink looks to be a "Dear Diary"-esque conversation with yourself.

That is where the UI started. Chat interfaces are ubiquitous now, and I wanted to replicate that. I also wanted to keep it simple and make writing the first priority.

## Features
- Multiple Journals. 
- Journals contain multiple entries.
- Entries are threaded in the journal, allowing easy review and recollection
- Entries are editable, deletable and downloadable. Want to turn that thought into a blog, cool. Hate how negative you were in a post? Edit it or maybe save it and write about it.
- Focus Mode
- Dark Mode
- Local Storage 
- Dead Simple.
