It is hard to onboard into a big open source project and make a difference. It's hard to know the nuances, the testing paradigm, the ramifications of the changes, etc. That's why I love reading and contributing to documentation. The barrier to entry is next to nothing and the review is not small but often trivial. 

Examples of changes that are low cost to the contributor and maintainer:

### Clarification
I got confused by the docs, so I offered up an edit to 1) validate my understanding was correct and 2) hopefully help someone down the road

### Grammar
My site is open for suggestions too.

### Added Details
Documenting is hard, time consuming and often falls as an after thought. Sometimes I just want more details without looking at the function call/scope.
