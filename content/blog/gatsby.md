## Background
I have been a Drupal developer since 2010. At that time, I had 0 development
experience and I didn't know HTML, CSS, PHP, etc. I fell into a situation where
the small mom-and-pop operation needed a commerce website to sell their product.
And with 0 knowledge in my pocket I felt I could build a site.

I asked my friend who was doing web development and she said "You should build a
Drupal site". Drupal 7.x just launched (I believe it was in BC), and drupal commerce
1.x had just come out. So building a commerce site on Drupal was definitely the
way to go.

Since then, I have cut my teeth quite a bit, I have learned a lot and have built
countless websites with the beautiful codebase and contrib modules that comprise
the Drupal ecosystem. There are things I love and things I loathe, but I know it
quite well to whip up this simple blog without hesitation.

But I chose not to.

## Why
1) A friend told me about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I listen.
1) I'm cheap. I don't want to pay for hosting this site.
1) My time is worth something.
   - I don't want to spin up a server to host this website. (Can I, yes. Should I, no.)
   - I don't want to maintain a server with my blog on it. I do that enough in my
  day to day affairs
1) Gatsby is built on React
1) Drupal is coupling with React
1) I love writing my posts in Markdown.

## Why I regret it
1) My time is worth something.
   - While I learned a lot with this project, I'm not sure it was overly useful
    or the time savings I was expecting
1) Because this is my first react project, I'm not sure what is specific to
Gatsby and what is best practice.  See the above point about time.
1) I traded the complexity of Drupal/Modules for Node/Packages. When I come back
to this in a year to do some dev work, how many things will be out of date and
how easy will it be to fix it? Time will tell.

## Lessons Learned
1) Have fun.
1) Templates are always the best way to learn. Take it apart, focus on it and
really ingest what is happening.
1) I missed writing.
