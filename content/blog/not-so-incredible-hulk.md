## Things done well
- Cameos (maybe)
- I made it through the whole thing. So I did well.

## Things done terribly
- Being in the MCU. Yes, there are references to Stark Industries and SHIELD,
and that's about it.
- Liv Tyler
- Dialog
- Edward Norton was careless:
  - He sent an email (unecrypted) with his name and data. Was he trying
 to be caught?
  - He sent his blood to a person he never met. Who does that?!
- The general had an injection the whole time and didn't try it on other people?
- Hulk Guy #2
  - Where is his hair?
  - Where are his pants?
  - Why would you just leave him behind?
  - Liv Tyler is simply the worst again... The hulk wasn't killing the bad guy out of rage. HE WAS KILLING THE BAD GUY! You know, the one that just killed a bunch of people and wreaked havoc
  on the city of New York... Oh and the guy that can't be cured because we just
  saw that there was no cure. How daft is your character?
