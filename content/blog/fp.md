I love functional programming and types because 1) I am lazy and 2) seek validation. 

Functional programming addresses both of my great character traits.

## Solving for Laziness
Writing code is easy, testing code is hard. More importantly testing permutations is hard
and permutations grow exponentially as the code base gets larger. FP allows us to avoid 
many of the pitfalls of these permutations through immutability. Which means testing our
code isn't nearly as difficult.

## Solving for Validation
Is there a better feeling than all your tests passing and feeling confident that it wasn't
just your local machine.
