Who decides what is spoon appropriate?

- Cereal and Milk? Check
- Potatoes and broth? Check
- Pretzels and Hummus? Nope
- Chips and Salsa? Nope
- Chips and Dip? Nope

Here is the fucking problem: What happens when you get down to the bottom of the bag of the pretzels and/or chips? Because society tells us we
should be ashamed of looking fat eating chips and dip with a spoon, we don't do it. And we should. 

So people, eat your damned chips and salsa any way you please. If you eat with chopsticks, good on you. Eat it with a spoon, I get it. But don't let
perfectly good chips and dip go to waste because you feel it is too indulgent to get it with a spoon.
