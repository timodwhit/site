I can't stop thinking aout giraffes and how freaking weird they are. 

> Unicorns are more believable than giraffes
>> Whatâ€™s more believable? A horse with a single horn, or a giant horse with long neck and legs, and two horns. It also uses its neck to fight

In that vein, we should start looking for more giraffes, not unicorns. Also, let's collectively stop saying "We're looking for a unicorn" and start saying "We're searching for the next giraffe." It's so much f-ing cooler, you will not convince me otherwise.

There's more to say on why giraffes are better than unicorns but the general idea is that if we search of the mythical when we need the practical, we lose out on a lot of potential. People can embody traits of a giraffe and you can find giraffe like start ups, engineers and more in the world, but you will never find unicorns (sorry).
