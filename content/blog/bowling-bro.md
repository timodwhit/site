Finding the perfect activity for a group of guys is difficult. I like to brunch, I like to happy hour, 
and I like long discussions. But those activities can be uncomfortable when getting to know someone
and finding that perfect activity to garner a friendship between male friends is difficult.

That is where **bowling** comes in. 

Reasons: 

1. Universally loved activity
1. Easy to make a game go as long or short as necessary
1. Neutral space 
1. Plenty of noise to distract
1. It is an activity that most people can do (ski-ing, climbing, soccer, et requires either equipment or similar skillsets)
1. Can include drinks but doesn't need to
1. You can bowl any time of the day or any season
1. It is fun as hell

So yeah, go bowling with a friend.
