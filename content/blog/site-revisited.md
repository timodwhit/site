I'm sick of this site.

## Reasons to be sick of this site
1) The logo has grown stale. It was meant to be both a TW and :// but it didn't pan out.
1) It's a blog and I'm not a blogger
1) Gatsby.

## Reasons I like this site
1) I am writing this post on github
1) Markdown is fully supported
1) The content map is shallow and easy to maintain

## Next Steps
I'm going to migrate this site into a NextJS code base and ideally update all the things to be more simple (besides the code)

```javascript
const maybe = () => Math.random() % 2 === 0
```
