## Where I started

Tiger Woods. He has a great logo with my initials. Don't copy that.

Then, I drew some logos, wrote out my initials, signed the page with my initials,
signed it with my full signature. Altered all that and tried again.

Turns out: My name does not belong on a bottle of cologne yet.

## Middle of the Road Idea

When signing my initials, I often make a 7 and then follow it with a half baked
W, more like a /. That transformed into 7/.

This turned into making sure // was in my logo and if I could accommodate ://
all the better.

The lowercase t in it's negative space creates a colon. An uppercase W contains
the //.

## Final Design

t//.
